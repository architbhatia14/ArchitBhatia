          <h1>Hello, Welcome to my page</h1>
          <p1>Archit Bhatia is a 4th year Computer Systems Engineering Student at Carleton University. From a very young
            age he became passionate about computers and their functionality, this led him to pursuing his degree in
            Computer Engineering. He is currently looking for a job opportunity where he could bring his skills and knowledge to action. 
            <br><br>
            Throughout his time at Carleton he had worked on many group projects which included
            research and development. During his 2nd year he worked in a group to research a safety layer to be applied
            in a hydrogen tank, he later presented the findings while explaining how the technology worked.
            <br><br>
            3rd year he worked on a Smart Shelf project to maximize the efficiency of stocking products on retail
            shelfs. For this
            project he worked on the GUI application, developing a basic user-friendly interface on an Android device
            using Android Studio. Later this application was connected to a database to add the user's information to
            the main database platform.
            <br><br>
            During the summer he works on personal projects, the most recent one being
            creating a website
            to learn basic HTML. This website was composed of different effects such as hovers and transitions which was
            used to display
            the skills learned throughout the project.
