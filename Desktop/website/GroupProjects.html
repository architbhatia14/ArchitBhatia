          <h6>Smart Shelf (3rd Year) </h6>
          <p6>This 3rd year engineering project's goal was to build a shelf for retail stores to make stocking the shelf
            and inventory more
            efficient. This project consists of three components, <br><br>1. The shelf which had all the hardware
            <br><br> 2.
            The data base to store
            all the information <br><br> 3. The GUI application.
            <br><br>Archit developed the GUI application using Android Studio,
            which he then had
            linked to the computer running the main data base to send user inputs of the item being stocked.
            The device was created using one Arduino and two Raspberry Pis. <br><br>The Arduino had sensors connected to
            them to detect how far the item is from the front and if the re-stock
            button was pressed the backing would move all the way to the back. Once all the sensing was done this
            information was stored
            into the database. The user was able to enter the product information such as name and price into the GUI
            when was then stored
            into the database.

          <h6> Elevator Subsystem (3rd Year)</h6>

          <p6>
            Developed a simulation for an elevator subsystem in Eclipses using Java. The project was broken up into
            iterations, the first iteration consisted of using UML diagrams to create the basic classes for the
            subsystem and have them connecting. This was done by using Server and Clients to send messages between the
            subsystems.
            <br><br>
            Iteration two required the addition of state machines to determine when and elevator has arrived at the
            location then send this information to the scheduler subsystem (main subsystem).
            <br><br>
            The final iteration required UDP packets to be send in order to allow the use of multiple elevator systems,
            each subsystem was setup on its own computer which sent UDP packets to communicate the states of where each
            elevator is. From this the system would detect which elevator was closest to the floor that has requested
            service and would go to the requested floor. This allowed for minimization of wait time for the person
            waiting at the floor and maximize efficiency of the system.
